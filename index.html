                        You have freedom here. The only guide is your heart. Everybody needs a friend. Do an almighty painting with us. We'll throw some happy little limbs on this tree.
                    </span>

                    <span>
                        Let your imagination be your guide. We artists are a different breed of people. We're a happy bunch. Painting should do one thing. It should put happiness in your heart. Life is too short to be alone, too precious. Share it with a friend. All you have to do is let your imagination go wild.
                    </span>

                    <span>
                        Look around, look at what we have. Beauty is everywhere, you only have to look to see it. Let the paint work. Brown is such a nice color.
                    </span>

                    <span>
                        You could sit here for weeks with your one hair brush trying to do that - or you could do it with one stroke with an almighty brush. We'll throw some old gray clouds in here just sneaking around and having fun. We'll play with clouds today. Be brave. In painting, you have unlimited power. You have the ability to move mountains. Working it up and down, back and forth.
